## Getting Started

1. **Install dependencies**:
   ```bash
   npm install
   ```

2. **Start development server**:
   ```bash
   npm run dev
   ```

3. **Build for production**:
   ```bash
   npm run build
   ```

## Firebase Setup

The app is already configured with Firebase. Make sure to:
1. Enable Authentication in Firebase Console
2. Enable Google Sign-in provider
3. Enable Firestore Database
4. Create a `users` collection in Firestore (will be created automatically on first registration)

## System Architecture

### Production System
- **Common Buffer**: 120 vehicle bodies capacity
- **Dual Ovens**: O1 and O2 operating simultaneously
- **Buffer Lines**: 
  - L1-L4: 14 vehicles each (Oven 1 exit)
  - L5-L9: 16 vehicles each (Oven 2 exit)
- **Main Conveyor**: Single-line pickup to Top Coat Oven

### Color Distribution (Daily Production ~900 vehicles)
- C1 (White): 40% | C2 (Silver): 25% | C3 (Black): 12%
- C4 (Red): 8% | C5 (Blue): 3% | C6-C11: 2% each | C12 (Pink): 1%

## Dashboard Modules

- **Control Center**: System overview and real-time monitoring
- **Color Sequencing**: Live visualization and optimization controls
- **Buffer Management**: Capacity monitoring and overflow prevention
- **Conveyor Lines**: Oven status and throughput control
- **Production Analytics**: Performance metrics and efficiency tracking
- **Vehicle Dataset**: 900+ vehicle data management
- **ML Optimization**: Algorithm performance and predictions
- **System Alerts**: Real-time notifications and issue management

## Smart Scheduling Algorithm Implementation

### Dynamic Color-Volume Based Allocation Strategy

**üîπ OVEN 1 (High-volume colors: C1, C2, C3)**
- **L1**: C1 dedicated (40% volume)
- **L2**: C1 overflow + C2 (25% volume) - flexible allocation
- **L3**: C2 dedicated 
- **L4**: C3 (12% volume) + C2 overflow

**üîπ OVEN 2 (Medium/low-volume colors: C4-C12)**
- **L5**: C4 (8%) + C5 (3%)
- **L6**: C6 (2%) + C7 (2%) 
- **L7**: C8 (2%) + C9 (2%)
- **L8**: C10 (2%) + C11 (2%)
- **L9**: C12 (1%) + Emergency overflow buffer

### Algorithm Features
